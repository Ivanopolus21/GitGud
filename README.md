# Main Menu
The game welcomes you to the main menu. Here you can click the "Start Game", "Settings" and "Exit" buttons. When you click the first button, the game will start, and when you click the "Exit" button, you can completely close the game window. The "Settings" button is currently not working and also quits the game.

# Game Goal
Here you are on the level! Your main task is to pass the level. To do this you have to defeat all the enemies. There is currently only one enemy in the game â€“ the Skeleton.
You have a full arsenal for this:
melee attack and gems too!
# Player Inputs
- Use the standard AD layout to walk. **A left, D right**.
- Press **Down Arrow** (or LMB) to attack.
- Press **spacebar** to jump
# Objects
The game has three types of items: collect, smash and kill. Collectors include **gems**.
Gems drop from broken objects - **gemstones**.

To break this type of item, simply approach it and hit it with an attack.
A red gem restores health when picked up,

**Spikes** are killer items in the game. If the player falls on them, they die instantly.

# Pause Menu
If you press the "Escape" button during the game, you will stop the game. In the "Pause" menu, you can replay the level, return to the main menu and continue playing. There are also some sound buttons, but there are no sounds in the game, so they don't do anything.
